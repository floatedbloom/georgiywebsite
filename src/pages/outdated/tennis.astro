					<h2 class="ftimes indigo centered">My Tennis Journey</h2>
					<p>I started playing tennis quite late, only seriously playing starting in my sophomore year. I had little talent and struggled a lot with even basic groundstrokes.
						Since those beginnings, I've played every year on the school's varsity team and in a nearby tennis club and have grown tremendously in such a short period.
						 Similarly to chess, tennis has taught me the importance of consistent practice and that anything is possible with enough effort.</p>
					<h2 class="ftimes indigo centered">My Favorite Tennis Youtube Channel</h2>
					<h4 class="centered"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@IntuitiveTennis" class="ftimes">Intuitive Tennis</a></h4>
					<p class = "centered ftimes">Intuitive Tennis is great youtube channel to watch for tennis improvement and for knowledge on the sport. 
						It is made by Nikola Aracic, a former D1 player and longtime coach. He uses his many decades of competitive and 
						coaching experience to explain tennis mechanics and tactics in the most intuitive way. Ever since I started watching him, 
						my tennis was improved dramatically and he helped me get rid of my bad technique and habits. 
						I urge anyone interested in tennis to watch Intuitive Tennis.</p>
