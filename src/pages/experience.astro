                    During the summer of 2023, George tutored an eighth grade student in math to successfully skip a full school course; improving dramatically at teaching in the process.   
                    Throughout the 2023-24 school year, he worked as a tutor for Everett Community College in various math subjects and the variety of students he was exposed to further
                    led to the development of new teaching skills. He is yet to have programming work experience, but is always open to it.
